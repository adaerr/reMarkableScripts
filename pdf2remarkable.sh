# Transfer PDF file(s) to a reMarkable
# Adrian Daerr 2017/2018 - public domain
#
# - The files will appear in reMarkable's top-level "My Files" directory,
# - After finishing all transfers, you have to restart the xochitl
#   service on the tablet in order to force a scan of its document
#   directory ${xochitldir} (so that you see the newly transferred
#   files), e.g. by sending the tablet the following command: 
#     ssh remarkable systemctl restart xochitl

# - This is a dirty hack based on superficial reverse-engineering.
# - Expect this script to break at any time, especially upon a
#   reMarkable system upgrade
# - I am not responsible for any damage caused by this script,

# Prerequisites:
#
# * The ssh access has to be configured under the host alias 'remarkable',
# e.g. by putting the following in .ssh/config :
# | host remarkable
# |        Hostname 10.11.99.1
# |        User root
# |        ForwardX11 no
# |        ForwardAgent no
# See also the variable "xochitldir" below
#
# * Beyond core utilities (date, basename,...), the following software
#   has to be installed on the host computer:
# - uuidgen
# - imagemagick (or graphicsmagick)

# This is where ssh will try to copy the files associated with the document
xochitldir=remarkable:.local/share/remarkable/xochitl/

# Check if we have something to do
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
